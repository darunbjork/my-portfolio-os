Day 1 Summary

Today, we initialized our entire project. We set up a clean, modular folder structure, configured our basic Express server with essential middleware (security, error handling), integrated environment variables, and laid the foundation for Dockerization. We also started our README.md and made our first Git commit. You now have a running, albeit minimal, web server!

Week 1, Day 1 ‚Äî Express Server Initialization & Docker Foundation
üéØ Feature or Topic
What did I build today?
Today, I initialized the My Production Portfolio OS project. I set up the basic project structure, created a minimal Express.js server, and configured the necessary files for Dockerization and environment variables. I also wrote the initial README.md and made my first Git commit.

üí° Design Decisions
Why did I do it this way? What tradeoffs did I consider?

Modular Folder Structure: Chose src/api, src/config, src/middleware, src/utils, tests, docs for clear separation of concerns, scalability, and maintainability. This structure is common in production Node.js apps.

Express.js: Selected Express as the web framework for its minimalism and flexibility, allowing us to build exactly what we need.

dotenv for Environment Variables: Used dotenv to load configurations from .env files, keeping sensitive data out of the repository. .env.example serves as a template.

helmet and cors: Immediately included basic security (Helmet for HTTP headers) and CORS handling, emphasizing secure-by-design principles from the start. cors was set to \* for local dev convenience, but noted the need to restrict in production.

Dedicated Error Handler: Implemented a central error handling middleware to provide consistent error responses and prevent leaking internal details.

Health Check Endpoint: Added a /health endpoint for monitoring, which is crucial for modern deployments with load balancers and orchestrators.

Dockerization: Adopted Docker from Day 1 to ensure environmental consistency and simplify future deployment. The Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml set up our application within a container. Volumes were used for development speed.

Conventional Commits: Started using conventional commits (feat:) for a clean, readable Git history.

‚úÖ Functionality
What behavior or feature is working now?

The Express server successfully starts using npm start and docker compose up.

The root endpoint (/) responds with "Hello World from My Production Portfolio OS!".

The health check endpoint (/health) returns a JSON object indicating server health and uptime.

Environment variables (PORT, NODE_ENV) are correctly loaded and used by the application.

Basic security headers (via Helmet) and CORS are enabled.

üîí Security
What vulnerabilities did I mitigate?

Sensitive Information Exposure: Prevented by ignoring .env in .gitignore and providing .env.example as a template.

Common Web Vulnerabilities: Mitigated by using helmet middleware which sets various security-related HTTP headers (e.g., XSS protection, clickjacking protection).

CORS Issues: Addressed by cors middleware (though \* origin needs production refinement).

Error Detail Leakage: The error handler prevents detailed stack traces from being sent to the client in a production-like scenario.

üß™ Testing
What did I test and how?

Server Startup: Verified the server starts successfully using npm start and docker compose up.

Endpoint Accessibility: Used curl to send GET requests to http://localhost:3000/ and http://localhost:3000/health to confirm correct responses and status codes.

Environment Variable Loading: Confirmed the server reported the correct port and environment from .env.

üóÇÔ∏è Git Commit Summary
Bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: Initialize project with Express server, Docker, and basic structure"
üê≥ Docker & Deployment Status
Did it build/run successfully? Any CI issues?

Dockerfile built successfully.

docker-compose.yml brought up the web service successfully, mapping port 3000.

The container ran as expected, and the application inside was accessible via localhost:3000.

No CI issues, as CI is not yet set up.

üìà What I Want to Improve Tomorrow
Code, tests, infra, docs, UX?

Start integrating MongoDB and Mongoose for data persistence.

Implement a User model and set up the foundation for JWT authentication.

Add more specific unit tests for the health check route and error handler.
