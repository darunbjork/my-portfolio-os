Day 3 Summary

Today, I built the core of our authentication system and resolved several critical issues that arose during development. I implemented the API endpoints for user registration and login, handling data validation, secure password hashing, and token generation. I also modularized our routes using the Express Router and introduced API versioning. However, I encountered and overcame several challenges that initially prevented the system from functioning correctly.
Week 1, Day 3 ‚Äî User Authentication Routes

üéØ Feature or Topic
I implemented the /api/v1/auth/register and /api/v1/auth/login API endpoints using a dedicated controller and router. I added logic to create new users in the MongoDB database and authenticate existing users, returning a JWT upon successful login or registration.

üí° Design Decisions
I separated route definitions from business logic, added API versioning, used modular routing, created a utility function for token responses, and returned generic authentication errors for security.

‚úÖ Functionality
Users can now successfully register and log in, with passwords being hashed during registration and valid tokens being returned on successful authentication.

üîí Security
I mitigated user enumeration attacks and ensured data integrity through schema validation.

üß™ Testing
I tested the endpoints using curl, verifying functionality, status codes, and database persistence.

üóÇÔ∏è Git Commit Summary
I made a commit that addressed multiple issues across Docker, API, and testing setup, ensuring the application is now robust and functional.

üê≥ Docker & Deployment Status
After resolving volume configuration issues in docker-compose.yml, the Docker Compose stack builds and runs successfully, with all services communicating correctly.

üìà What I Want to Improve Tomorrow
I plan to implement middleware for protecting routes using JWT, build the /api/v1/auth/me endpoint, create a custom validation error class, and start writing unit tests for our controllers.

- darunbjork@MacBookAir my-portfolio-os % git status
  On branch main
  Your branch and 'origin/main' have diverged,
  and have 2 and 1 different commits each, respectively.
  (use "git pull" if you want to integrate the remote branch with yours)

nothing to commit, working tree clean

- my git status indicates that local main branch has diverged from the origin/main branch. This means:

- You have 2 commits on your local main branch that are not yet on origin/main.
- origin/main has 1 commit that is not yet on your local main branch.

---

- Here's the procedure I followed to resolve the Git branch divergence:

  1.  Diagnose Divergence:

      - I used git status to identify that your local main branch and origin/main had diverged, meaning both had unique commits not present on the other. The output indicated "Your
        branch and 'origin/main' have diverged".

  2.  Attempt Initial Pull (and identify need for strategy):

      - My first attempt was a simple git pull.
      - This failed because your Git configuration didn't have a default strategy for reconciling divergent branches, prompting a message like "fatal: Need to specify how to
        reconcile divergent branches."

  3.  Choose and Execute Rebase Strategy:

      - To create a clean, linear history, I chose the rebase strategy. This method fetches remote changes and then reapplies your local commits on top of them.
      - I executed the command: git pull --rebase
      - Outcome: This successfully integrated the remote commit and re-applied your local commits. Your git status then showed "Your branch is ahead of 'origin/main' by 1 commit."
        (or similar, indicating your local branch was now ahead).

  4.  Push Rebased Changes:

      - Since your local branch was now ahead of origin/main after the rebase, the next step was to push these changes to the remote repository.
      - I executed the command: git push
      - Outcome: This successfully updated origin/main with the rebased history.

  5.  Final Verification:
      - I ran git status one last time to confirm that your local main branch was "up to date with 'origin/main'", indicating the divergence was fully resolved.

  This process ensures that your local and remote branches are synchronized with a clean, linear commit history.
