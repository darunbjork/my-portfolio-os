Day 3 Summary

Today, I built the core of our authentication system and resolved several critical issues that arose during development. I implemented the API endpoints for user registration and login, handling data validation, secure password hashing, and token generation. I also modularized our routes using the Express Router and introduced API versioning. However, I encountered and overcame several challenges that initially prevented the system from functioning correctly.
Week 1, Day 3 — User Authentication Routes

🎯 Feature or Topic
I implemented the /api/v1/auth/register and /api/v1/auth/login API endpoints using a dedicated controller and router. I added logic to create new users in the MongoDB database and authenticate existing users, returning a JWT upon successful login or registration.

💡 Design Decisions
I separated route definitions from business logic, added API versioning, used modular routing, created a utility function for token responses, and returned generic authentication errors for security.

✅ Functionality
Users can now successfully register and log in, with passwords being hashed during registration and valid tokens being returned on successful authentication.

🔒 Security
I mitigated user enumeration attacks and ensured data integrity through schema validation.

🧪 Testing
I tested the endpoints using curl, verifying functionality, status codes, and database persistence.

🗂️ Git Commit Summary
I made a commit that addressed multiple issues across Docker, API, and testing setup, ensuring the application is now robust and functional.

🐳 Docker & Deployment Status
After resolving volume configuration issues in docker-compose.yml, the Docker Compose stack builds and runs successfully, with all services communicating correctly.

📈 What I Want to Improve Tomorrow
I plan to implement middleware for protecting routes using JWT, build the /api/v1/auth/me endpoint, create a custom validation error class, and start writing unit tests for our controllers.
