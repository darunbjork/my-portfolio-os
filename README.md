# My Production Portfolio OS

## üåü Overview

Welcome to **My Production Portfolio OS**! This project is a comprehensive, production-grade full-stack web application designed to showcase my skills as a software engineer. Built with the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack, it aims to demonstrate best practices in secure design, modular architecture, testing, and modern DevOps deployment.

This repository serves as a public showcase of my journey from a complete beginner to a proficient full-stack developer, emphasizing a deep understanding of every line of code and every architectural decision.

## üöÄ Features (Planned)

- **User Authentication & Authorization:** Secure user registration, login, and role-based access control.
- **Dynamic Portfolio Management:** Create, update, and manage various portfolio items (projects, articles, achievements) with rich content support.
- **Admin Dashboard:** A dedicated interface for managing all aspects of the portfolio.
- **Contact Form & Messaging System:** Allow visitors to reach out directly.
- **Cloud Infrastructure & Deployment:** Fully Dockerized application with CI/CD pipeline for automated deployments.
- **Observability:** Integrated logging and monitoring.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

### Backend

- **Node.js:** JavaScript runtime environment.
- **Express.js:** Fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js.
- **MongoDB:** NoSQL document database.
- **Mongoose:** MongoDB object data modeling (ODM) for Node.js.
- **JSON Web Tokens (JWT):** For secure user authentication.
- **Bcrypt:** For password hashing.
- **Helmet:** Express middleware for setting security HTTP headers.
- **CORS:** Express middleware for enabling Cross-Origin Resource Sharing.
- **Dotenv:** For loading environment variables.

### Frontend (Planned - will be added in later steps)

- **React:** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **React Router:** For declarative routing in React applications.
- **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.

### Infrastructure & DevOps

- **Docker:** Containerization platform for consistent environments.
- **Docker Compose:** Tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications.
- **Git & GitHub:** Version control and code hosting.
- **CI/CD (e.g., GitHub Actions):** For automated testing and deployment.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup and Installation (Development)

To get this project running on your local machine:

1.  **Clone the Repository:**

    git clone https://github.com/darunbjork/my-portfolio-os.git
    cd my-portfolio-os

    _(Note: Replace `https://github.com/your-username/my-portfolio-os.git` with your actual repository URL once created.)_

2.  **Install Backend Dependencies:**

    npm install

3.  **Environment Variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and populate it based on the `.env.example` file:

    cp .env.example .env

    # Now open .env and fill in sensitive variables if any.

    # For Day 1, simply:

    # PORT=3000

    # NODE_ENV=development

4.  **Run with Node.js (without Docker):**

    npm start

    Your server should be running at `http://localhost:3000`.

5.  **Run with Docker Compose:**
    Ensure Docker Desktop is running on your machine.

    docker compose up --build # --build forces a rebuild of the image

    Your server should be running inside a Docker container, accessible at `http://localhost:3000`.

## ‚úÖ Testing the Server

Once the server is running, you can test the endpoints:

**1. Root Endpoint (`/`):**

curl http://localhost:3000

Expected Response: Hello World from My Production Portfolio OS!

2. Health Check Endpoint (/health):

curl http://localhost:3000/health
Expected Response (JSON):

JSON
{
"status": "success",
"message": "Server is healthy!",
"timestamp": "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.sssZ",
"uptime": [number]
}
